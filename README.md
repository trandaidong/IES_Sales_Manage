# Sales Management System
This repository presents a fully functional sample restaurant management system, featuring both a modern frontend built with React and Vite, and a robust backend developed with Node.js and Express.
The system is designed to streamline core restaurant operations, including:
- Menu management – allowing the creation, updating, and deletion of food and beverage items.
- Order processing – handling customer orders efficiently from placement to completion.
- Integration with essential services, such as MySQL for reliable data storage and Nodemailer for sending email notifications.
This project aims to provide a practical example for developers learning full-stack web development, demonstrating frontend-backend communication, RESTful API design, database integration, and third-party service usage.
It can serve as a foundation for building more complex restaurant or retail management systems, with the flexibility to add features like authentication, reporting, or payment gateway integration.
